## Context

In a digital context where services are provided to users via the Internet, a dedicated application may be required.
However, the breadth of options available in today's technological landscape may raise questions as to the best option possible in a given context.

This document is to identify key considerations when the choice to develop the application is narrowed between:

- A device-based mobile application
- A progressive web application (PWA)

## Definitions

Web application: A software that is accessed and used via a device's web browser.
It requires a constant access to the Internet to be used.

Progressive web application: A software that is accessed and used via a device's web browser. It does not require constant access to the Internet to be used.

Device based mobile application: A software that is accessed and used directly on a mobile device, without the use of a web browser.

## Assumption

Proper user research has been conducted and the need for a dedicated application to provide a service is clear.

## Comparison
