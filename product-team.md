# Digital Service Team Models

The purpose of this document is to provide a general overview of standard digital service and product team models seen in application within the Government of Canada.

## Definitions

### Digital Service

Based on the Policy on Service and Digital, the definition of a service is the provision of a specific final output that addresses one or more needs of an intended recipient and contributes to the achievement of an outcome.
Among the expected results of the Policy, one is primordial to the Canadian Digital Service: Service design and delivery is client-centric by design.
The practices associated with this result are not traditionally found in the government’s departments so we put a lot of effort into improving this capability with our partners, among other things such as ensuring accessibility and security by design, working in the open, using iterative development, etc.
In order to provide services that meet the population’s expectations, the use and the development of products will often be required in order to scale the capability of the service teams.
However, digital product management practice and methodologies are not commonly found across the government where projects are used to plan and manage changes to underlying systems.

### Digital Product

For the purpose of this document, we will refer to Digital Product simply as a Product.  A product is usually a tangible item that generates value to an end user, without the need for someone else’s intervention to benefit from it. A product may sometimes require surrounding services, which would imply the intervention of a service provider, in order to generate the value.
An example could be when a person purchases a vehicle, the product, and the contract includes oil changes for a period of time, the services.
In the digital realm, a software as a service doesn’t necessarily mean that a person will directly interact with the end user but a service provider will be necessary to maintain and update the software used over time. While the end user may be able to configure the software on their own, issues would be directed to customer support which would be another service around the core product.

### Digital Service Team

A digital service team is typically described as a small, multidisciplinary and self-sufficient set of professionals dedicated to the development and maintenance of a service and its product over their lifetime.
When referring to private sector terminologies, specifically the concepts from the [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts), a Digital Service Team would be called  a [Stream-Aligned team](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/team-topologies). These teams are typically in  charge and normally enabled to fully manage the service and its underlying products. They have the responsibility to meet all mandatory requirements as much as possible on their own, throughout the entire life cycle.
The United Kingdom’s Government Digital Service (GDS) has defined such teams as multidisciplinary team that can create and operate the service in a [sustainable way](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-6-have-a-multidisciplinary-team), meaning that the same individuals will be working during an extended period of time exclusively on a given service and its products, and will not need repeated external approvals for design and technical decisions.
These teams still rely on other teams to provide the required environments to develop and operate their service, but they benefit from a lot more freedom while taking more responsibility.
Stream-Aligned Team Model
The GDS provides a good idea of the roles and skills required for a successful service team in a [Service Team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team), which is akin to a Stream-Aligned model:

A team building a government service needs to have people with the following roles or skills either in the team or available to it:

- product manager
- service owner
- delivery manager
- user researcher
- content designer
- designer
- developer

As stated above, the skills and roles would be needed but they wouldn’t necessarily be required on a full time basis.
For example, a product manager would be required at all times, but user researchers and content designers may only be needed during initial development and on a recurring basis as the service receives end users’ feedback and as the team conducts further research on user experience.
